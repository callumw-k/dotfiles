description: Use when a written artefact is about to ship or be pushed anywhere other people read it, including specs, Jira tickets, Confluence pages, PR and commit descriptions, and reports. Also use when a document feels bloated or padded, when it has been edited several times, or straight after a humanizer or line-editing pass.

# callum-stop-slop

A document-level editing pass. The unit is the **claim**, not the phrase. A document can pass every sentence-level check and still say one thing five times.

**If the text has not had a line-level pass yet, run `humanizer` first, then this.** Signs it has not: em dashes, bold-label paragraph openers, "serves as" and "stands as", sales adjectives, chatbot leftovers. If it reads clean at sentence level and still feels padded, it has had that pass and needs this one instead.

Do not run the line-level pass twice. Re-editing prose that is already clean is where over-compression starts, and a sentence trimmed to reference detail that has been deleted reads worse than the original.

## The pass

1. **List the claims.** Read the whole document and write down each distinct thing it asserts. Not sentences, claims.
2. **Count where each appears.** Include restatements, consequences, and defences of the same point.
3. **For any claim appearing more than once, keep the one instance a reader needs at the moment they read it, and delete the rest.** Not reword. Delete.
4. **Re-read each surviving sentence cold.** If it only makes sense to someone who read what you deleted, rewrite it to stand alone.

## The three-move pattern

The most common form of bloat, and the one to hunt first:

1. State the instruction
2. Restate it as a consequence
3. Defend it against an alternative nobody proposed

Move one survives. Two and three go.

> The attribute carries a real link or nothing, with no default value. Every lead whose type has a configured survey gets a link. A lead type without one has no journey either, so nothing downstream encounters the attribute missing. Putting a placeholder URL there would only create a case where an invitation's button opens the homepage.

becomes

> `survey_url` is set only when a link is built. There is no default value.

**The three moves are often three paragraphs, not three sentences.** This form is harder to see and survives most editing passes. One paragraph states that a thing cannot fail, the next says a related case is also not a failure, the third names the only remaining failure. Each reads as new information and none is. When consecutive paragraphs all argue the same property, merge them into one and keep the strongest statement.

## Never reword a repeat to disguise it

In baseline testing, half the agents found a duplicated claim, kept both copies, and varied the wording of one "so it does not read as boilerplate". They filed this under removing AI tells.

Varying the wording is worse than leaving it alone. The reader still reads the same claim twice, and now the two copies no longer match on a text search, so nobody can find them later.

If a claim genuinely belongs in two places, say it the same way both times, and treat that as a signal the document wants restructuring.

## Two guards

**Do not cut the reason for a decision.** Design rationale looks like padding and is not. In baseline testing an agent deleted "with no network call" and the reason a table has no TTL, calling both hedges, while keeping five restatements of one rule. Before cutting a clause, ask whether it tells the reader why, and whether they could rebuild the decision without it.

The same applies to an instruction hiding inside a descriptive clause. "The full answer set as a generic pass-through of whatever questions exist" reads like a flourish on "the full answer set", but it tells the reader not to build a fixed field list. Trimming it loses a build decision.

**Do not fix facts you have not verified.** An editing pass is not the place to correct identifiers, field names or claims. In baseline testing an agent "unified an inconsistency" between `questionsAnswered` and `questionAnswered` and introduced a bug. Flag suspected errors, never silently resolve them.

## Hard style rules

- No em dashes and no en dashes. Use commas, colons, full stops or parentheses.
- No semicolons.
- Australian and British English. Initialisation, not initialization.
- No emojis unless asked.
- No bold-label paragraph openers or bulleted mini-headings. If every paragraph starts with a bolded phrase, that is the tell.

## Forward-facing artefacts

Specs, tickets and team documentation describe what gets built, not how the team arrived at it. Cut:

- Decision-log narrative, dates and "revised", "reversed", "previously assumed"
- Comparisons against what the codebase used to do or nearly did
- Definition by negation. "No vendor abstraction" only parses for a reader who knows there once was one. State what is, not what is absent.

The exception is a working file that exists to track decisions, like a decon. History belongs there.

## Quick reference

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Same claim in two sections | Delete one |
| Paragraph makes one point four ways | Keep the first sentence |
| Consecutive paragraphs all argue the same property | Merge into one |
| Sentence defends the design against an unraised objection | Delete it |
| A repeat you reworded rather than cut | Cut it |
| Sentence references detail you deleted | Rewrite to stand alone |
| Every paragraph opens with a bold phrase | Remove the labels |

## Common mistakes

**Editing paragraph by paragraph.** Repeats spanning sections are invisible that way, and they are the majority. Hold the whole document.

**Cutting until it is terse rather than until it is unrepeated.** Density is not the goal. One clear statement of each claim is.

**Treating a scope or safety statement as a repeat.** Deliberate limits, legal notices and named open questions stay, even when they restate something.
